A higher score might indicate a more defined, clear rhythm.\n####  ** AudioLoudness **:  The overall average loudness of the audio track. Loudness is a key acoustic property, and its values often exist on a logarithmic scale, which is why they can be negative.\n####  ** VocalContent **: The proportion or a score of how much of the audio track is dominated by vocals. A high value would mean a song is primarily vocals, whereas a low value would be for instrumental tracks\n####  ** AcousticQuality **:  This could be a measure of the sound quality or fidelity of the recording\n####  ** InstrumentalScore **: his is likely a measure of how much of the track is purely instrumental. It's often inversely correlated with VocalContent\n####  ** LivePerformanceLikelihood **: A score, often between 0 and 1, that quantifies the probability that the recording is from a live performance rather than a studio recording\n####  ** MoodScore **: : A numerical score attempting to quantify the emotional tone or mood of the song. It could represent a spectrum (e.g., from sad to happy) or a specific emotion.\n####  ** TrackDurationMs **: : The duration of the song in milliseconds\n####  ** Energy **: : A perceptual measure of a track's intensity and activity. Songs with a lot of movement, a loud feel, and a fast tempo usually have a higher energy score\n####  ** BeatsPerMinute **: his is a direct measure of the song's tempo. A higher number means a faster song.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Let's begin our Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's characteristics.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"explore.info()","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-09-21T15:33:39.277470Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-09-21T15:33:39.278032Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-09-21T15:33:39.342919Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-09-21T15:33:39.277975Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-09-21T15:33:39.341835Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Initial finding \n\n#### -
